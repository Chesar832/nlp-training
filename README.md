# Key NLP Topics and Exercises 

This document outlines key Natural Language Processing (NLP) topics essential for a strong foundational understanding, along with corresponding questions and practical exercises to reinforce each concept.

Some of the responses will be probably related to the Natural Language Processing in Action (2Â° edition) book because this repo was born for that book in my search to build a strong foundational understading about NLP topics while I'm also learning about transformers in depth with their applications to NLP tasks such as machine translation, text classification and so on.

## 1. Text Preprocessing Techniques

**Question:**

What are the common text preprocessing techniques in NLP, and how do they impact the performance of NLP models?

**Exercise:**

Take a raw text dataset (e.g., social media posts) and perform various preprocessing steps such as tokenization, lowercasing, stop word removal, stemming, and lemmatization. Observe how these steps affect the vocabulary size and prepare the data for downstream NLP tasks like sentiment analysis.

## 2. Tokenization and Text Normalization

**Question:**

What is tokenization in NLP, what are the different types of tokenizers, and why is text normalization important?

**Exercise:**

Implement different tokenization methods (e.g., whitespace tokenization, word tokenization, and subword tokenization) on a sample text. Compare how each method breaks down the text and discuss the implications for tasks like machine translation or language modeling.

---

## 3. Text Representation Techniques

**Question:**

What are the differences between bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and word embedding approaches for text representation, and what are the trade-offs between these methods?

**Exercise:**

Use a text classification dataset (e.g., classifying emails as spam or not spam). Represent the text data using bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and word embeddings. Train a classifier (e.g., logistic regression or SVM) with each representation and compare their performances in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

---

## 4. Language Models and N-grams

**Question:**

How do n-gram language models estimate the probability of a word sequence, and what are their limitations in capturing long-range dependencies in language?

**Exercise:**

Use a large text corpus (e.g., a collection of news articles) to build unigram, bigram, and trigram language models. Calculate the probabilities of various sentences using these models and analyze how increasing the n-gram size affects the model's ability to predict word sequences.

---

## 5. Evaluation Metrics in NLP

**Question:**

What is perplexity, how is it used to evaluate language models, and why might it be insufficient in certain scenarios, necessitating alternative evaluation metrics?

**Exercise:**

Train different language models (e.g., unigram, bigram, and trigram models) on a text corpus. Calculate the perplexity for each model on a validation set. Additionally, evaluate these models using task-specific metrics like accuracy in next-word prediction to assess how well perplexity correlates with actual performance.

---

## 6. Word Embeddings

**Question:**

How do Word2Vec models generate word embeddings, and what is the difference between the skip-gram and continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) architectures?

**Exercise:**

Train Word2Vec models using both the skip-gram and CBOW architectures on a text dataset (e.g., Wikipedia articles). Compare the resulting word embeddings by performing tasks like finding word analogies and computing word similarities.

---

## 7. Sentiment Analysis with Naive Bayes

**Question:**

How does the Naive Bayes algorithm perform sentiment analysis, and what are the implications of its assumption of feature independence?

**Exercise:**

Apply the Naive Bayes algorithm to a sentiment analysis dataset (e.g., movie reviews labeled as positive or negative). Evaluate the model's performance and discuss how the independence assumption affects the results. Experiment with techniques like feature selection or n-gram features to improve accuracy.

---

## 8. Part-of-Speech Tagging with HMMs

**Question:**

How are Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) applied to part-of-speech tagging, and how does the Viterbi algorithm find the most probable sequence of tags?

**Exercise:**

Implement an HMM for part-of-speech tagging using a tagged corpus like the Penn Treebank. Utilize the Viterbi algorithm to predict the sequence of POS tags for unseen sentences and evaluate the model's accuracy.

---

## 9. Named Entity Recognition (NER)

**Question:**

How are Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) used for Named Entity Recognition, and what advantages do they offer over generative models like HMMs?

**Exercise:**

Implement a CRF model for NER using an annotated dataset (e.g., the CoNLL-2003 NER dataset). Experiment with different feature sets such as word shapes, prefixes, suffixes, and part-of-speech tags. Evaluate the model's performance and compare it to an HMM-based NER system.

---

## 10. Topic Modeling with LDA

**Question:**

How does Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) perform topic modeling, and how do Dirichlet distributions model the relationships between documents and topics?

**Exercise:**

Apply LDA to a collection of documents (e.g., articles from various news categories). Extract topics by examining the most significant words associated with each topic. Validate the coherence of the topics and explore how the number of topics chosen affects the results.

---

## 11. Sequence-to-Sequence Models with RNNs

**Question:**

How do Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), especially LSTMs and GRUs, handle sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation, and how do they mitigate the vanishing gradient problem?

**Exercise:**

Build a sequence-to-sequence model using RNNs with LSTM units for a simple language translation task (e.g., translating short sentences from English to French) using a parallel corpus. Train the model and evaluate its translation quality on a test set.
